# InspirationsWerkzeug
A basic tool to help you get some inspiration from the websites you chose

InspirationsWerkzeug(short form coming soon) isn't even an app that lets you drag links from your browser into a field to be saved in a file.

You can drag as many links in there as you'd like, I haven't really tested how stable it is though.. I haven't really tested anything to be honest,
it's still a little early for that. For now I just know that the basic functions work, which brings me to the next point

Features!
There's 4 fully interactive buttons that allow you to modify your collection of links for optimal Inspiration

"Hinzugefügt" - the "Added" button lets you see what has been added to the list , don't worry about formatting, that'll come soon enough I hope

"Inpiration" - together with the number field above, this button lets you call a set amount of entries from the list to be opened in your browser

"Duplikate" - "Duplicates" does what I think you already know, it searches and destroys duplicate entries (or rather puts it in a dict, thanks Google c: )

"Löschen" - "Delete" is there for when the police are at your door and you only have one thing left to do, delete your InpirationsWerkzeug history!
